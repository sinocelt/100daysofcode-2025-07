In Linux, use CTRL + SHIFT + v to preview markdown in Visual Studio. And double click on the text area to go back to markdown.

You can also preview markdown to the side with CTRL + K (then release keys) + v. So CTRL + K + V together at the same time won't work, but CTRL + K then release the keys and type on "v" will have the markdown panel to the side.

Don't forget, you can also use CTRL + SHIFT + p, to open the command pallette, and search for markdown preview options in there.


Markdown roughly will convert to simple HTML, but it's simpler to type than HTML generally.

# Headers
# H1 tag (line starts with 1 '#')
## H2 tag (line starts with 2 '#')
### H3 tag (line starts with 3 '#')

## Horizontal rule
It is composed of 3 '*' or 3  '-' or 3 '_'
***

___

# Code

## Single backticks for inline code

## Three backticks for multiline code (note there is no syntax highlighting)
```
def hello_world():
    print("hello world")
```

## Syntax Highlighting
Add language name, such as python, right after the three backticks to add syntax highlighting

```python
def hello_world():
    print("hello world")
```

# Bold and italics

## Bold
To make a single word or group of words bold, surround them with ** on the left side and ** on the right side

For example:

Dogs are wonderful vs Dogs are **wonderful**

## Italics
To make a single word or group of words italic, surround them with a single underscore _ on the left side and a single underscore _ on the right.

For example:

He said what? versus He said _what?_


Note, if you were to add 2 underscores on each side, it would actually make it bold.

# Bold and Italics

You can combine bold and italics together for text. For example:

Qatar is VERY rich. I saw a Lamborghini in their Doha airport.

versus

Qatar is _**VERY**_ rich. I saw a Lamborghini in their Doha airport.  
versus


# Line Breaks
If you want a line break, there are a few caveats in Markdown. Often, if you type text and then hit enter meaning to do a new line, Markdown will render the 2 lines as 1 line.

You can either:

* Hit enter twice to get 2 new lines
* End the first line with 2 spaces
* use a break tag from HTML

- first
- second

# Lists

## Unordered, bulleted list.

Use either '*' or '-' at the start of each line and put a space, then put your text

**Shopping list:**
* oranges
* apples
* bananas
* water
* bread
* durian (if available)

## Ordered, numbered lists

Put a number at the start of each line, put a space, and then put your text.

<strong>My goals</strong>
1. Financial
2. Fitness
3. Social

# Links and images

## Links (non-images)
The general form of a link in Markdown is like below:  
jack-o-lantern emoji ðŸŽƒ [Alt text](the_url)

For example:
jack-o-lantern emoji ðŸŽƒ ```[jack-o-lantern emoji](https://emojipedia.org/jack-o-lantern)```

This part of markdown corresponds roughly to anchor tags in HTML

## Image links
The general form of an image n Markdown is like below:  
jack-o-lantern emoji ðŸŽƒ ```[Alt text](the_url)```

The main difference between a general link and an image link is that an image link starts with "!"

For example:
Image from Pexels:  
jack-o-lantern with image ðŸŽƒ ![jack-o-lantern emoji](https://images.pexels.com/photos/236277/pexels-photo-236277.jpeg)

This corresponds roughly to `<img>` tags in HTML


# Block Quotes

You just need to start a line or paragraph (without extra empty lines in between) with ">" symbol

For example
Quoting from Shakespeare's Hamlet:

>To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether â€™tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To dieâ€”to sleep,
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to: â€™tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wishâ€™d.
