## Building a *free* email list from scratch  
### (Goal: 100+ subscribers in one year)

Below is a **step‑by‑step playbook** that starts with nothing, assumes you’ll post videos on YouTube and other platforms, and scales to a working email stack that only costs you time (and a little storage).

> **Why an email list?**  
> • Directly reach the people who care about your content.  
> • 10‑100× better ROI than paid ads.  
> • Gives you a “home” for every video, article, or product.

## 1.  The Baseline: Pick a *Free* Email Service

| Provider | Free Tier Limits | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------------------|------|------|
| **Mailchimp** | 2,000 contacts, 12,000 emails/mo | Big UI, marketing automations | Unlimited list still costly |
| **MailerLite** | 1,000 contacts | Light load, clean editor | Limits on automation steps |
| **ConvertKit** | 1,000 contacts | Great for creators | Some advanced features locked |
| **Moosend** | 1,000 contacts | Unlimited emails | UI not as polished |
| **Substack** | Unlimited proposals | Zero cost, built‑in monetization | Mostly newsletters, not a full stack |

**Recommendation:**  
Start with **MailerLite** – it’s absolutely free for 1,000 contacts, gives you a clean editor, built‑in landing pages, and integrations with WordPress / YouTube. If you need more advanced automations later, you can migrate without scrapping data.

## 2.  Set Up Your Email List (Week 1)

| Step | What to Do | Tool |
|------|------------|------|
| 2.1 | Create an account, name your newsletter | MailerLite (or chosen provider) |
| 2.2 | Add a **Two‑Step Opt‑In** (“Double Opt‑In”) – improves deliverability and compliance | |
| 2.3 | Configure a clean “Welcome” email (intro + first value bundle) | |
| 2.4 | Prepare a **privacy policy** link (GDPR/CAN‑SPAM) | |
| 2.5 | Install the provider’s **form or landing page** builder on your website | |
| 2.6 | Export the form’s embed code / share link for YouTube / socials | |

> **Tip:** Use *one*: a single list, single sub‑form. It keeps your data clean and automations simple.

---

## 3.  Create a Compelling Lead Magnet (Week 2‑3)

- **What fits a video creator?**  
  - A “10‑Minute Editing Cheat Sheet” PDF (or a cheat‑code list).  
  - A mini‑audio podcast behind the scenes.  
  - An exclusive “behind‑the‑video” 5‑minute clip.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  - It gives you something tangible to collect prospects’ emails.  
  - It validates you as an authority in your niche.

**Actionable Checklist**

| Item | Done? |
|------|-------|
| 1. Create the PDF/asset | ☐ |
| 2. Host it (Google Drive, DropBox, or your own server) | ☐ |
| 3. Build a one‑page landing form for it | ☐ |
| 4. Set up a “Thank‑you” page with link back to content hub | ☐ |

---

## 4.  Embed the Opt‑In in Every Online Presence

| Platform | Where to Place | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **Website** | Footer, popup, CTA button (above fold) | Use PB elements that show only once. |
| **YouTube** | Description: “Get the cheat sheet here → [link]” | Add a timer‑tag at 0:25: “Grab your free guide (link below)” |
| **Vimeo / Dailymotion** | Description, comment pinned | |
| **Instagram / TikTok** | Bio link (Linktree or shortened URL) + short video “swipe up (IG)” | |
| **Facebook** | Page “Call to Action” button | |
| **Twitter** | Tweet with link + CTAs repeated each week | |

> **Pro:** The more channels you tap, the higher the cumulative reach.  
> **Con:** Avoid spammy “Everyone must sign up” language—give context (“I’ll send you a secret video tutorial”).

---

## 5.  Get the First 30 Voters From Your Video Viewers (Month 1)

1. **Channel Hook** – In the first 5 seconds of each video, say, “I’ve a free guide for you; hit the link in the description.”  
2. **Description CTA** – “👉 Get your free copy → [URL]” – bold, bold.  
3. **Pinned Comment** – Repeat the CTA with a short video reminder.  
4. **Outro Slide** – Visual overlay that says “Link in the description.”  

**Estimated Reach:**  
- 1,000 views per month (realistic for a new channel) → 10‑20% click‑through → 20 subscribes.  

> Test: Set up a spreadsheet to record **Which videos** convert best. Adjust headline CTAs.

---

## 6.  Grow Through Curated Content & Community (Month 2‑3)

| Strategy | Execution |
|----------|-----------|
| **Add a drip series** | 2‑3 emails that take a new subscriber: 1) Welcome + value; 2) How to use the cheat sheet; 3) Teaser for next video. |
| **Ask for mini‑reviews** | “What’s your biggest video problem? Reply & you’ll get the next video idea.” |
| **Leverage existing social reach** | Post a 1‑minute teaser on TikTok, Instagram stories clues about the guide. |
| **Cross‑promotions** | Reach out to 3‑5 creators in adjacent niches for shout‑outs or guest videos that embed your opt‑in. |

**Target:** 20–30 more subscribers per month by building momentum.

---

## 7.  Refine & Automate (Month 4‑6)

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| **Deliverability** | Confirm emails are ESP‑approved. Use MailerLite’s free / integrated test. |
| **Highlight key metrics** | Open rates, click rates – aim 20–25% open. |
| **Segment** | Start with 2 groups: ‘Video watchers’ and ‘Blog readers’. |
| **Follow‑up** | Set up a welcome email with a “video you’ll miss” CTA. |
| **Landing page updates** | Add a small testimonial (“I’ve learned so much!”). |
| **Consistency** | Pick a day/time once per week (e.g., Thursday at 12 pm PST). |

> **Pro Tip:** Use MailerLite’s built‑in *Visual Editor* to test subject lines with A/B testing (free!).

## 8.  Sprint to 100 Subscribers (Month 7‑12)

| **9** | Offer a limited‑time “exclusive clip” only to email list (social → email). | +15 |
| **10** | Run a poll in email: “What topic would you like next?” | +10 (plus engagement) |

## 11.  Final Note: Keep It Simple

- **Don’t over‑automate** in the first six months; a manual follow‑up feels more personal.  
- **Batch your content** – do 2 videos per week, 1 email per week, and cross‑top‑off each other.  
- **Treat your list as an audience, not a number** – it's the people who will eventually buy your products, books, courses.  

With consistent effort, a well‑crafted lead magnet, and a clear call‑to‑action across all your channels, **you can easily hit 100+ subscribers in a year without spending a cent** on ad spend. Good luck, and enjoy building and engaging with your very own community!
