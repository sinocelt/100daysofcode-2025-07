      "|------------|----------------|\n",
      "| **Keep the opt‑in simple** – 1‑field is best for cold traffic. | Asking for phone numbers or “age” – it kills conversions. |\n",
      "| **Speak the same language** in video, description, and landing page. Consistency builds trust. | Using jargon in the lead‑magnet title that your audience doesn’t understand. |\n",
      "| **Test headlines** every 2‑3 weeks. Small changes (e.g., “FREE” vs. “FREE + BONUS”) can add 5–10 % more sign‑ups. | Forgetting to update the link when you switch to a new lead‑magnet. |\n",
      "| **Reward sharing** – make it easy for people to forward the email (add a “Forward to a friend” button). | Sending sales pitches before the subscriber has received 2–3 value emails. |\n",
      "| **Track everything** – bitly clicks, ESP source tags, YouTube Analytics. | Relying on “one‑off” spikes (e.g., one viral video) without building a systematic funnel. |\n",

      "### TL;DR Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Zero‑cost tech stack** – MailerLite + Carrd/Google Sites + Canva.  \n",
      "2. **One high‑value freebie** → landing page → email capture.  \n",
      "3. **YouTube‑centric traffic**: verbal CTA + description link + repurposed blog/posts.  \n",
      "4. **Community pushes** (Reddit, Discord, FB groups) for extra traffic.  \n",
      "5. **Welcome series + weekly 150‑word newsletter** → build trust.  \n",
      "6. **Quarterly upgrades & referral contests** → organic growth.  \n",
      "7. **Milestones:** 10 subs (Week 1), 30‑40 subs (Month 3), 60‑80 subs (Month 8), **100+ by Year‑End**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow the month‑by‑month checklist, log your numbers each week, and iterate on what works. With consistent video output, a clear opt‑in offer, and the automated nurture flow above, hitting **100+ engaged subscribers in 12 months** is very realistic—often even sooner if a single video goes viral. Good luck, and happy list‑building! 🚀\n"
